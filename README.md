This is my attempt at the playerdata technical task.
To run the tasks, you should firstly run leaderboard.py, and then heatmap.py. To run these, you may need to install pandas, matplotlib and numpy (if you havent already)

Upon running leaderboard.py, you should be met with three seperate leaderbaords as outputs.

And upon running the heatmap.py, you should be met with a heatmap of the player data metrics drawn on a graph, alongside the ball data. The blue data is the ball metrics and the red is the player metrics.
